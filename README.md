# Exploratory data analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a very important step which takes place after feature engineering and acquiring data and it should be done before any modeling. This is because it is very important for a data scientist to be able to understand the nature of the data without making assumptions.
The purpose of EDA is to use summary statistics and visualizations to better understand data, and find clues about the tendencies of the data, its quality and to formulate assumptions and the hypothesis of our analysis.
